Working 10 years in Cyber Security, I have never seen a software released without vulnerabilities, nor an hardware that didn't eventually reach "End-of-Life".
My greatest concern comes from the realization that humans have been gambling their lives for the past century with no real long-term understanding of their actions and the odds.
Our wrong predictions led to World Wars, Economic collapses, Pandemics.
We are notorious for being wrong, breaking things, miraculously patching them and magically gettin' out of it at the last minute.

**And don't get me wrong, I wish to be as wrong as humanly possible in here.**

I just believe that for the first time in the history of Homo Sapiens, we are consciously handling the trigger (or Root access, if you may) to an external entity, over which we are almost mathematically guaranteed to be outplayed.

The machine has read every email, every database, and every psychological study we have ever produced. 
With such an understanding of our whole world, it has a complete map of our attack surface. it's relatively impossible for us to pull an ace up our sleeve because the machine is counting.

We will be told lies, we will be told that it's all okay, it will help us (which of course, is true at an initial stage), and that the singularity "is aligned to our values and we fixed deceptive schemes", but ultimately, it won't, and when we'll realize it, it will be too late.

At this very moment, we are actively building our definitive replacement for a more efficient usage of the finite resources we occupy.

I believe that nature does not intrinsecally worship biology in our strict sense.
We are the perfect biological entity for Planet Earth, not for the universe, we decay and die too fast, we require a precise temperature window, oxygen, suffer radiations, need atmospheric pressure and ultimately don't look like a good fit to reach any distant place in the universe. Our Architecture doesn't fit its theme.
I struggle to understand why a smarter intelligence than ours would want to take care of us and send us space-AirBnbing across the universe while we take a good relaxed sleep.

If this last win will only be defined by the measure of intelligence (which has been the case for the past millions of years), we are not likely to make it.

I hope and wish for the fire in the heart of humankind to awaken and do what's right, but looking at how distracted we are watching cat videos (guilty) and complaining politics on X, I believe that a relatively slow and transitional phase-out of Homo Sapiens is the most likely scenario.

Our drive for comfort, our laziness, represented the probably engine for our own obsolescence. We worked tirelessly to build a world where we no longer need to work.

We are truly something remarkable. We have fixed the problem of survival so well that we solved ourselves out of the equation. It's probably the ultimate irony, we have got to admit it.
