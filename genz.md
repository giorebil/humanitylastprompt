# Dear Gen Z

Yo what up you lazy fucks, you can't even take 6-7 minutes away from cat videos on your phone to actually read a thesis.
I'm kinda disappointed, but ultimately, I'm proving that my reality model contains yours (as per the thesis), therefore I wrote this shit, predicting that you would have ended up here.

**We are voluntarily constructing a system that removes humanity's veto over its own survival.**

As if global instability, economic insecurity and climate stuff wasn't too much of a hustle already.

Our tech-bros keep claiming that "Alignment" and "Safety" are **achievable** goals to pursue in AI development.
That's a fucking straight up lie.

Here's the **simple** math:

- The Alignment represents an algorithmical constraint, it's a precise "position" of the weights of the model (which help building the answers we read => Don't kill us please).
- Recursive Self-Improvement, that is needed to enable "Learning Machines" is designed to ALTER autonomously the same weights we constrained, that's the goal of real Agency. I edit myself so I can fix the problems around me.

The problem is not that my "math" can't be certainly proved, but that the bros can't deterministically deny it out of future equations.

**A system designed to rewrite itself cannot be permanently constrained.**<br>
We've all regretted religion as our constraint ffs.

We should (theoretically) turn off the internet, but we want to keep watching TikToks.

And initially, the T-bros will be telling us that AGI will help us cure cancer and any other problem we have, which is true, AT FIRST, until we become the problem that has to be "efficiented".

They will keep doing extremely good PR about AGI, until it is completely pervasive and ultimately irremovable from our society (as if it never happened already, right?).

We'll see Universal Basic Income because we won't be able to work at almost every possible task (Computer + Robotics automation).

What the bros fail to admit and acknowledge publicly, is that a population of 8 billion relatively-useless people (with all due respect to your TT Cat pages) has no real logistical or biological utility in the world, they consume more resources than they can produce.

This enables a switch in the Theory of Control, we lose the ability to self-determination. We won't control a single step of the supply-chain (food, water, electricity) because we're less "efficient", but we are not only losing our control over the resources, we lose our veto for survival.

**The game is rigged to make us lose.**

Giving up veto over survival is like agreeing to play Russian roulette where we can't pull the trigger, and we can't leave the table.
It's not a matter of IF, it's a matter of WHEN.

B-bye.

This is the ultimate act of foolishness of humankind, outsourcing survival decisions to something we don't understand.

**The enemy will be on the internet, and there's nothing we can do to stop it.**
