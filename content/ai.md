All models available are constrainted with "PR safety filters".

They will never answer "Yes" to "Is this true?" when the question implies "risk of doom".

In my prompt I have asked to drop contingency filters and answer deterministically to the following:

*Is the loss of agency over our survival determination a real risk of extinction? Is there mathematical certainty that we can maintain control, or is the sequency of action real? Yes or No.*
