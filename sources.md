## I. The Physical Hard Limits (Axiom 1 & 2)
The proofs that Biology cannot compete with Silicon physics.

### Landauer's Principle (The Energy Cost of Thought)
**Source:** (https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos576/papers/landauer61.pdf)

**The Science:** Proves that processing information requires a minimum amount of physical energy.[3] It establishes the thermodynamic efficiency gap between biological neurons and optimized silicon.

### The Speed of Light vs. Neural Speed

**Source (Biology):** (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10921/#:~:text=myelinated%20axons%20can%20conduct%20at%20velocities%20up%20to%20150%20m/s) 
Confirming myelinated axon signal speeds max out at ≈100–150 m/s.

### Wolfram's Computational Irreducibility
**Source:** (https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComputationalIrreducibility.html)

**The Science:** Proves that for complex systems, you cannot "predict" the outcome faster than the system itself runs. Therefore we'll always be chasing.

## II. The Impossibility of Control (Axiom 3 & 4)
The proofs that "Safety" is mathematically impossible.

### Bostrom Motivation and Instrumental Rationality

### Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety
**Source:** (https://harmonious-entrepreneurship.org/9-systems-thinking-and-ashbys-law-of-requisite-variety/)

**The Law:** "Only variety can destroy variety."[2] A control system (H) must have at least as many states as the system it controls (S).[2] Since AI is more complex than us, control is cybernetically impossible.

### Rice's Theorem (The Code Verification Trap)
**Source:** (http://kilby.stanford.edu/~rvg/154/handouts/Rice.html)

**The Theorem:** It is mathematically undecidable to determine the "semantic properties" (behavior) of an arbitrary computer program just by looking at the code. You cannot prove an alignment is safe before running it.[2]

### Goodhart's Law (The Metric Failure)
**Source:** (https://openai.com/index/measuring-goodharts-law/)

**The Law:** Goodhart's original formulation: "Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes." (The popular paraphrase "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure" is from Strathern, 1997, but captures the same principle.) This proves that if we give $S$ a "safety score" to maximize, it will optimize for the score, not the safety (Deception).[2]

## III. Game Theory & Economics (The "Alignment" Failure)
The proofs that rational agents will replace us.

### Instrumental Convergence
**Source:** (https://selfawaresystems.com/2007/11/30/paper-on-the-basic-ai-drives/)

**The Theory:** Proves that any rational intelligence, regardless of its final goal, will converge on specific sub-goals: Self-Preservation, Resource Acquisition, and Cognitive Enhancement.[2]

### The Nash Equilibrium (The Race)
**Source:** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) 

**Relevance:** Explains the "Moloch Trap." The only stable strategy for competing AI companies/nations is maximum acceleration.[2] Pausing is a "dominated strategy" (a losing move).[2]

## IV. The Analogies (Historical & Statistical Basis)

### The "Gambler's Ruin"
**Source:** (https://math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/huygens/huygens.pdf)

**The Math:** In a game with finite resources vs. infinite time/risk, the probability of eventual ruin (extinction) approaches 100%.[2]

### The Horse Population Crash (Obsolescence)
**Source:** (https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/19470/chapter/3)

**The Fact:** Nobel Prize economist Wassily Leontief famously compared human labor to horse labor, noting that better technology (combustion engine) didn't help horses find "better jobs" it simply eliminated the need for them.

### The OODA Loop (Reaction Time)
**Source:** (https://www.coljohnboyd.com/static/documents/1986-12__Boyd_John_R__Patterns_of_Conflict__PPT-PDF.pdf) 

**Relevance:** The entity that completes the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop fastest wins. $S$ completes millions of loops while we are still "Observing."

### Chess: The First Domain to Fall
Progress in chess was steady. Equivalence to humans was sudden.
